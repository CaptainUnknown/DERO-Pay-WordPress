## Customization üéõÔ∏è
**On Complete Purchase**:

`completePurchase.js` - It exports a custom function that is called when the transaction has been made. `completePurchase` is a very basic function that sends the server a POST Request with ``$user_id`` & ``courseID`` as a parameters. You can add any functionality or change the REST Endpoint in `completePurchase.js` to better suit your needs.

`index.php` - To add any custom script/styles to the plugin, just enqueue the scripts/styles in `index.php`. `onInit` Scripts are loaded in the editor while `onRender` is called on preview & final page.
